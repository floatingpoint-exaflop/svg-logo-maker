  ## Description
  This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Nine of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice making a command-line application using Node.js packages and writing files with data exports collected from inquirer prompts. The complete set of responses is gathered to generate a README file that also includes a graphical badge for the License chosen (from several open-source options); the badge itself serves as a hyperlink to an official webpage for that License. The README you’re currently reading was actually generated by me copy/pasting prewritten blocks of text as prompt responses for my actual function’s prompts, via the vsCode terminal. I learned a lot about the limits and syntax of more complex template literals, and the clean formatting output makes this an excellent choice if you’re not the type to want to rework your previous READMEs into new ones.

  ## Installation
  To install this project after copying down the repo, you will first need to run npm init (-y for default settings) on the project root, and then npm i inquirer@8.2.4 ; Use of other/newer versions of inquirer are not recommended for this project unless I can figure out how to update the inquirer syntax in the actual js code.

  ## Usage
  To use this project, ensure you have the node packages installed as specified in the Installation section above. Then open a terminal on the project root and simply run node index.js - from there, just answer the questions!

  ## Contributing
  If you want to contribute to this project - particularly if you know how I might refactor the code so it works with later versions of inquirer, see my contact info in the Questions section below. Don’t hesitate to reach out! I am a beginner at this stuff but always hungry to learn from others in the community. I might add validation for responses at some point; I am aware inquirer supports this functionality to an extent.

  ## Tests
  Testing a project that is this simple might be more trouble and time than it’s worth since I largely tested it with iterative runs of node index.js as I built it, but scenarios to consider could include checking outcomes for null or blank (not sure what a non-response counts as in Node.js), or ensuring the badge can be dynamically generated for license options beyond the original five provided in the code.
